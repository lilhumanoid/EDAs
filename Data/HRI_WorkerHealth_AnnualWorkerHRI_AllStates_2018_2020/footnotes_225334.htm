													<li><p>Data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII). Data were obtained through the BLS API. If interested in SOII survey methods, including the scope of the survey, please see <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/soii/pdf/soii.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/soii/pdf/soii.pdf.</a></p></li>
													<li><p>Data can be found through BLS database tables for workplace injuries, nonfatal cases involving days away from work: selected characteristics (2011 forward). Data are for all ownerships, all industries, and exposure to environmental heat. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/#injuries">https://www.bls.gov/data/#injuries.</a></p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>
Measures 1&#45;3 are derived from the U.S. Department of Labor&apos;s Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. The survey provides annual information on the incidence rate and number of work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatal injuries, and how these statistics vary by incident, industry, geography, occupation, and other characteristics. These data include measures relating to exposure to environmental heat.
</p>
<p>
Measure 4 is derived from the U.S. Department of Labor&apos;s Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses by multiplying the annual median worker days lost due to exposure to environmental heat by injury and illness cases due to exposure to environmental heat.

<li>The Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses is an establishment-based survey used to estimate incidence rates and counts of workplace injuries and illnesses.</li>
<li>Not all states have available data. Participation is voluntary. State law dictates whether establishments must participate.</li>
<li>Only certain industries with more than 10 employees are required to keep the records.</li>
<li>Volunteers are not always included.</li>
<li>Federal employees are not included.</li>
<li>Counts less than 15 are suppressed.</li>
