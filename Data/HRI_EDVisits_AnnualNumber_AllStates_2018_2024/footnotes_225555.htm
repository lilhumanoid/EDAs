													<li><p>The emergency department visits data shown here are provided by state and/or local public health departments to the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program.</p></li>
													<li><p>Emergency department visit records are selected using primary and other diagnosis codes and emergency department visit date between May 1 and September 30 for each year.</p></li>
													<li><p>These data represent number of emergency department visits rather than number of individuals. For example, a person visting the emergency department twice in one year would count as two visits.</p></li>
													<li><p>Data from Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Services and institutionalized (e.g., prison) populations are not included in the dataset submitted to National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program.</p></li>
													<li><p>Emergency department visits of residents to out-of-state hospitals are excluded for most states. Visits for border counties may be under estimated. The inclusion of these visits by some states can make affect state to state compariability.</p></li>
													<li>On October 1, 2015 in the US, ICD-10-CM replaced ICD-9-CM for coding of medical terminology and disease classification. This coding change impacts information classifications for hospital discharge, emergency department, and outpatient records for administrative and financial transactions in all healthcare settings. In 2015, data were coded as ICD-9-CM from January to September and as ICD-10-CM from October to December in 2015. Differences in counts and rates of heat stress illness in years prior to 2016 (ICD-9-CM) compared with 2016 and subsequent years (ICD-10-CM) could be a result of this coding change and not an actual difference in the number of events.</li>
													<li><p>Differences in the data between states or counties or over time may be due to the differences in coding, diagnostic techniques, and hospital admission practices.</p></li>
													<li><p>CDC Tracking Network suppresses data for counties with non-zero counts less than 6 and population less than 100,000 to protect confidentiality.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p><strong>Measures 1-3:</strong></p><p>Heat-related illness can manifest in several clinical outcomes, and people with chronic health problems (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity) are more susceptible to the effects of heat than healthy individuals. For these reasons, heat-related illness may not be listed as the primary diagnosis. These measures, therefore, include all cases where heat-related illness is explicitly listed as the primary diagnosis or any other diagnosis<strong>.</strong></p><p>Increases in the rates of ED visits for heat-related illness are one potential impact of rising global temperatures. Tracking these data can help document changes over place and time, monitor vulnerable areas, and evaluate the results of local climate-adaptation strategies.</p><p><strong>Measures 4-5:</strong></p><p>ED visits associated with HRI were identified using a combination of keywords based on reported symptoms, physician assessments, and discharge diagnoses indicating exposure to high ambient temperature. These near real-time data can be used by public health agencies to plan for and communicate the risk of HRI as ambient temperature increases. Potential uses include</p><ul><li>Assessing the severity of an ongoing heat event</li><li>Providing evidence for needing response resources (e.g., requesting additional cooling center hours or water distribution sites)</li><li>Preparing emergency department personnel for visit surges during severe, prolonged heat waves</li></ul></p>

				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>On October 1, 2015 in the United States, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) replaced the ninth revision (ICD-9-CM) for coding of medical terminology and disease classification. As a direct result of this change, there are nearly five times as many diagnosis codes in ICD-10-CM than in ICD-9-CM, allowing further expansion than was possible with ICD-9-CM. This coding change impacts information classifications for hospital discharge, emergency department, and outpatient records for administrative and financial transactions in all healthcare settings. Differences in counts and rates in years prior to 2015 (ICD-9-CM) compared with 2016 and subsequent years (ICD-10-CM) could be a result of this coding change and not an actual difference in the number of events.</p><p>Periods of extreme heat are frequently associated with increases in hospital visits and admissions for many causes. This measure does not capture the full spectrum of heat stress, where exposure to excess heat is not explicitly documented.</p></p>
