													<li><p>The hospital data shown here are provided by state and/or local public health departments to the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program.</p></li>
													<li><p>Data are based on the date of admission rather than the date of discharge. For these measures, admission date is limited to between May 1 and September 30 for each year.</p></li>
													<li><p>Hospital admission records are selected using primary and other diagnosis codes.</p></li>
													<li><p>These data represent number of admissions rather than number of individuals admitted to the hospital. For example, a person admitted twice in one year would count as two admissions.</p></li>
													<li><p>Data from Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Services and institutionalized (e.g., prison) populations are not included in the dataset submitted to National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program.</p></li>
													<li><p>Data for transfers of a single episode between hospitals have not been excluded.</p></li>
													<li><p>Admissions of residents to out-of-state hospitals are excluded for most states. Admissions for border counties may be under estimated. The inclusion of these admissions by some states can affect state to state comparability.</p></li>
													<li>On October 1, 2015 in the US, ICD-10-CM replaced ICD-9-CM for coding of medical terminology and disease classification. This coding change impacts information classifications for hospital discharge, emergency department, and outpatient records for administrative and financial transactions in all healthcare settings. In 2015, data were coded as ICD-9-CM from January to September and as ICD-10-CM from October to December in 2015. Differences in counts and rates of heat stress illness in years prior to 2016 (ICD-9-CM) compared with 2016 and subsequent years (ICD-10-CM) could be a result of this coding change and not an actual difference in the number of events.</li>
													<li><p>Differences in the data between states or counties or over time may be due to the differences in coding, diagnostic techniques, and hospital admission practices.</p></li>
													<li><p>CDC Tracking Network suppresses data for counties with non-zero counts less than 6 and population less than 100,000 to protect confidentiality.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>Heat stress can manifest in a number of clinical outcomes, and people with chronic health problems (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity) are more susceptible to the effects of heat than healthy individuals.  For these reasons, heat stress may not be listed as the primary diagnosis. This indicator therefore includes all cases where heat stress is explicitly listed as the primary diagnosis or any other diagnosis.</p><p>Increases in the rates of hospital admission for heat stress are one potential impact of rising global temperatures. Tracking these data can help document changes over place and time, monitor vulnerable areas, and evaluate the results of local climate-adaptation strategies.</p></p>

				<p><ul><li>Using a measure of all heat stress hospitalizations will include some transfers between hospitals for the same individual for the same heat stress event.

				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>On October 1, 2015 in the United States, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) replaced the ninth revision (ICD-9-CM) for coding of medical terminology and disease classification. As a direct result of this change, there are nearly five times as many diagnosis codes in ICD-10-CM than in ICD-9-CM, allowing further expansion than was possible with ICD-9-CM. This coding change impacts information classifications for hospital discharge, emergency department, and outpatient records for administrative and financial transactions in all healthcare settings. Differences in counts and rates in years prior to 2015 (ICD-9-CM) compared with 2016 and subsequent years (ICD-10-CM) could be a result of this coding change and not an actual difference in the number of events.</p><p>Periods of extreme heat are frequently associated with increases in hospital visits and admissions for many causes. This measure does not capture the full spectrum of heat stress, where exposure to excess heat is not explicitly documented.</p></p>
